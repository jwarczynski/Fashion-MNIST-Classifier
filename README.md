# Fashion-MNIST-Classifier

This repository contains an implementation of a simple neural network for classifying images from the FashionMNIST dataset. It was developed as part of an assignment for generative artificial intelligence classes.

## Features

- **Model Development**: A straightforward feedforward neural network architecture.
- **Weights & Biases Integration**: Real-time model monitoring and logging.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizations of input images, predictions, and performance metrics (e.g., confusion matrix).
- **Training & Evaluation**: Detailed documentation of training procedures and evaluation results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- wandb
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Fashion-MNIST-Classifier.git
   cd Fashion-MNIST-Classifier
